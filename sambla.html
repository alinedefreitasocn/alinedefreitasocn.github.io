        Our team of three embarked on a two-week project to develop a predictive
        model for new loan applications using real-world data consisting of
        thousands of observations and 44 features. We started from
        scratch and successfully created a model integrated
        with a user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        The primary objective was to assess the
        eligibility of individuals for loans and determine the maximum
        loan amount they could receive based on the personal information
        provided through a website form. To accomplish this, we employed
        Streamlit to construct the website and execute the model, utilizing
        the input features provided by the users. Leveraging Streamlit,
        we constructed a user-friendly
        website that integrated our model and utilized
        user-provided input features.
      </p>
      <p>
      Throughout the project, we faced some challenges that we successfully overcame
      with collaborative efforts, meticulous feature engineering,
      and model fine-tuning.
      </p>

      <h4>Problems faced</h4>
      <p>
        During our project, we faced two main challenges.
        Firstly, the masking of real people's information in the dataset
        negatively impacted the model's performance, resulting in a
        significant decrease in the correlation between features and
        the target variable. However, through careful analysis, feature
        engineering, and model optimization, we were able to improve the
        models' performance and mitigate the impact of the masked data.
        </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, we encountered a highly unbalanced dataset,
        with the loan rejection being predominant while the accepted were
        underrepresented. This presented a challenge in training accurate
        models, as they tended to favor the majority class and struggled
        to make accurate predictions for the minority classes. To address
        this, we employed specialized techniques to handle class imbalance,
        ensuring fair and reliable predictions across all classes.
      </p>


      <h4>Key Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>
        <li>Performed data preprocessing tasks to optimize data ingestion into Python.</li>
        <li>Implemented data cleaning techniques.</li>
        <li>Addressed missing values effectively based on each feature.</li>
        <li>Utilized One-Hot Encoding to transform categorical data into a format suitable for analysis.</li>
        <li>Applied scaling techniques to normalize numerical features based on their distribution.</li>
        <li>Developed a robust pre-processing pipeline to streamline data transformation and preparation.</li>
        <li>Contributed to the development of the website, ensuring seamless integration of data engineering components.</li>

          We proudly presented our final project at Le Wagon Lisbon on the
          16th of June, 2023. The presentation was a success, and we had the
          honor of having it recorded and published on YouTube. This not only
          allowed us to showcase our hard work and achievements to a wider
          audience but also served as a valuable resource for future
          reference and inspiration. We are thrilled to have had the
          opportunity to share our project with the Le Wagon community and beyond.
