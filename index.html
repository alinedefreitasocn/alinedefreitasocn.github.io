                      <p>
                        My bachelor's degree in Oceanography allowed me to understand the environment as a whole. 
                        Studying the dynamics of coastal environments from mangroves to sandy beaches; 
                        understanding the geological formation of cliffs and islands; analyzing water quality 
                        in rivers and estuaries; connecting the atmosphere and the oceans through wave generation, 
                        heat exchange processes, and the ocean acidification process. Those are some of the concepts 
                        an oceanographer can bring to the table.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Furthering my knowledge, my master's degree added an engineering perspective to my projects. 
                        I collect various types of data directly from the field and institutional instruments to analyze 
                        and <strong>understand the environment</strong>. Based on these findings, I propose sustainable tourism development plan
                         for a highly seasonal coastal city in Brazil and offer solutions based on the <strong>Building with Nature</strong> 
                         concepts to address coastal erosion challenges.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I firmly believe that everything is connected, from the ocean to the land, and we should consider the bigger 
                        picture when facing local issues. With the effects of global warming affecting us all, I am eager
                         to use my data and environmental experience to make positive changes in people's life. <strong>I am 
                         actively seeking opportunities</strong> to work on urban management, green projects, and finding ways to addapt to  
                         the new challenges ahead.
                         </p>
                        <p>
                        If you are searching for someone to contribute with <strong>data-driven solutions</strong> who is passionate about the 
                        environment and dedicated to 
                        sustainability, I would be excited to join your team. Together, let's create a greener and more 
                        resilient future.
